Help requests, problem repotrs, etc. will now be managed by a forum using the ["discussion"](https://github.com/WinTestEdt/WinTestEdt/discussions) feature of GitHub.
This is a forum based discussion with optional [email suppot](https://github.com/WinTestEdt/WinTestEdt/discussions/12) for notifications and replies.
