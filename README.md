## WinTestEdt ["discussion"](https://github.com/WinTestEdt/WinTestEdt/discussions) 

This is a demonstration for all WinEdt discussions, help requests, beta testing, etc to replace the 
list server: winedt+list@wsg.net

Help requests, problem repotrs, etc. will now be managed by a forum using the ["discussion"](https://github.com/WinTestEdt/WinTestEdt/discussions) feature of GitHub

To open a new discussion, help request, etc you must have a GitHub account
